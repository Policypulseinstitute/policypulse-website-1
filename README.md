This is the code that is behind the https://www.policypulse.institute/ website.

## Setting up Policy Pulse on your computer

In order to have the code for this website and be able to make changes it is necessary to follow these steps:

1. Obtain a local version of the repository:
    Using the terminal, go to folder that you want to have the repository in and clone the repository:

    `git clone https://github.com/diego-lda/policypulse-website-1.git`

    This will request Github your username and password. After making changes remember to push your changes, preferably to a separate branch than _main_.

2. Using the terminal go to the folder that has the repository and run:

    `npm start`

    This should open a browser window and show the website in action.

3. Open your code editor (like VS Code) with the project folder. From this editor you will be able to make changes and after saving them they will automatically show on the website.
